# AD-DS-DHCP-DNS-Implementation

## Project Overview
This project involves the development and configuration of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), a DHCP server, and a DNS server. It also includes the integration of a workstation VM and a file transfer server, as well as the creation and management of user accounts and groups.

## Project Objectives
- Streamline network management.
- Automate IP address allocation.
- Manage domain name resolution.
- Enhance network efficiency and security.

## Project Components
### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Setup
- Installed and configured AD DS on a Windows Server 2019 platform.
- Created and managed user accounts, groups, and organizational units (OUs).
- Implemented Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for security policies and configurations.

### User and Group Management
- Created and managed user accounts to control access to network resources.
- Organized users into groups based on roles and responsibilities.
- Applied group policies to enhance security and standardize configurations.

### DHCP Server Configuration
- Installed and configured the DHCP server role on a Windows Server.
- Defined scopes and IP address pools for automated distribution.
- Configured DHCP options and policies for optimal network performance.

### DNS Server Implementation
- Installed and configured the DNS server role on the AD DS server.
- Created and managed DNS zones and records.
- Configured forward and reverse lookup zones for efficient name resolution.

### Workstation VM Integration
- Set up a Windows 10 VM as a domain-joined workstation.
- Ensured proper communication with the AD DS.
- Applied GPOs for security and management.

### File Transfer Server Addition
- Installed and configured a Linux-based file transfer server (FTP/SFTP).
- Integrated the server with AD DS for centralized authentication.
- Secured file transfer protocols and configured appropriate permissions.
